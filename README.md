# BIRD Lab
We study how, when, and why animals adjust their morphology in flight. Our research aims to inspire highly maneuverable and adaptable uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and to advance our understanding of biological flight. The work integrates biological and engineering knowledge and uses both experimental and numerical techniques.

This organization serves as a common repositories for projects related to BIRD Lab research. Repositories will be made public as the associated publications become public.

# Goals
To identify fundamental biological principles and attributes relating to flight that can be optimized and refined to improve engineered systems.

## Values
- Science and engineering are not purely objective pursuits. We aim to recognize our own biases in all work to ensure that we are advancing science in an inclusive and equitable manner.
- Integration of multiple disciplines and backgrounds provides a more holistic picture of science. We seek to incorporate a variety of perspectives along with different tools and approaches into our work.
- Life and science are uncertain. We aim to quantify and/or estimate the uncertainty on all experimental, numerical, and analytical methods used in our work.
